### KOHO QA Assignment

### Installation

This project is tested on ***Node v10.15.1***.  While earlier versions of node may be compatible, they have not been tested or verified.

I have made it so each feature file runs one at a time, it is possible to run all but for visibility purposes it set to 1 browser at a time. 

Requirements: 
***Node v10.15.1***
***NPM v6.4.1***
***Chrome browser(latest)***

To run test:
***npm install***
***npm run test***

Note:
Registartion might be blocked by catpcha test is initiated by angel.co. 
At the moment there does not seem to be a way to automate the capthca issue.
Even if a pause is present to allow time for user to complete the captcha it will not pass since the automated browser is detected by the website.
